# Neovim config
To set themes you need to see the source code and create
in your home directory a file named `.themes.json`. In this
file you will put your themes settings.

## This is an example syntax
```
{
    "editor": "onedark"
    "variant": "cool"
}
```

In a future commit I will show how te set up themes correctly
to use this file. At this moment see the code base and implement your themes.
